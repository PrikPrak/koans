Question: Is it better to use obj.nil? or obj == nil, Why?

My Answer: My guess is that it's better to use the .nil method rather than
finding out through a conditional expression. 

As a beginner Ruby programmer who has reviewed the .nil? method's definition, 
I know that only the nil object wil respond true to nil. I'm unaware of the 
implicit promotions or idioms that take place in ruby when utilizing the
conditional operator (For example, in C when comparing an integer or a float, how the integer is promoted to be interpreted as a float.), so it's better to be sure
than not.
